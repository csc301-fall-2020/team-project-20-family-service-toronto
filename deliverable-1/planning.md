# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME
> _Note:_ This document is meant to evolve throughout the planning phase of your project.   That is, it makes sense for you commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). Most importantly, it is a reflection of all the planning you work you've done in the first iteration. 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**
   
   Our Application's target users are seniors but can also be used by people whom are less technologically literate. The key functionality of our application is to make mobile phone more approachable and less daunting to unfamiliar users. Especially due to the events of COVID-19, many users have become more dependant on using technology such as the mobile phone for everyday services. This is compounded by the fact that members of the senior community are especially vulnerable in the current global health emergency. Many of the useful technologies such as Facebook and Zoom have complicated interfaces that is incredibly discouraging to these users and can lead to frustration and avoidance. Our application aims to make the experience easier and less intimidating for senior users. Which we hope will help members of the senior community become more accustomed to using some of the fantastic tools we have today. 
  

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them
 * The user stories should be written in Github and each one must have clear acceptance criteria.
  
User Stories:
1. As an 82 year old man, Thomas wants to be able to simply click a name to have a video call with his grandchildren without having to deal with the confusing settings and small menus of Zoom.
2. As a 66 year old, Ethel wants to be able to watch baking recipes on YouTube just by searching and clicking on a related video without having to deal with so many buttons and recommendations/autoplay and subscriptions from YouTube.
3. At 72, Ming wants to be able to see all the emails and app notifications he gets in one place without having to remember which app does what, and where they are in his app drawer and miss something important.
4. At 78 years old, Geeta wants to see and bookmark results for her web search without the clutter of pages and pages of results, sponsored content and ads, complicated tabs, advanced settings, and bookmark folders.
5. At 68 years old, Greg would like to be able to open up the app, and start messaging his friends and keeping up with his family on Facebook in just a few clicks without the overwhelming number of settings and buttons and tabs on the Facebook app that he can't find on his home screen.
6. At 87 years old, Zorya wants to be able to use the basic functions of her phone like check the weather or call her daughter without having to navigate through different apps and an overwhelming phone UI.

## Process Details

#### Q6: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)
 
 Tiago Ferreira

- I will take on the role of a Fullstack engineer. I will work to integrate some of the Company API's into our application and then build out simple front-end components that utilize those API's to provide our senior uses a simplified and easier to use version of that specific app (E.G. Using the Youtube API to built a simple coomponent that only allows you to search for videos and see the top 10 results and nothing else, and plays the video selected (See Mockup for better context)). 
 
 - ```3 technical strengths```: Multiple internships so I am familar with working in a large team to develop software, familar with working with all kinds of API's using multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.), and familar building out UI'S for apps and websites using languages and frameworks like (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, React, Etc.). 
 - ```3 technical weaknesses```: Unfamilar with IOS development using tools like Xcode and languages like Swift, unfamiliar with some company API's we might need (E.G. Facebook & Zoom), and no experience building mobile applications in an industry environment so may be unfamiliar with industry standards.
 
Kshitij Shah

  - I will take on the role of a front-end developer. This involves developing user facing components in the applications. Primarily implementing visual elements that users interact with and additionally acting as a translator from user input to functionality on the back-end. This includes responsibilities such as implementing the UI, and making it suitable for different screens/use cases, accepting and validating user inputs when appropriate, mechanism for presenting feedback to users, etc. 
 
  - ```3 technical strengths```: 
    - I have experience working with creating MVP's in small teams with Agile methodology from previous a internship.

  - ```3 technical weaknesses```:
    - My mobile experience is limited to that from A1, using React Native. I have 0 experience with native development on iOS/Android and languages/tools/best practices for design.
    - I've never worked directly with API's written by other people, so incorporating API's from existing products (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, ...) that our software will integrate or working with backend's implemented by other team members will be challenging.
    - In previous experiences, I have been in full control of the product/stack; I followed my own style guide/development strategy as opposed to integrating with others.

Ziyao Han

 - I will take on the role of a Quality Assurance Engineer. In this role, I will ensure that our application meets the requirements of the product owner and work to guard the application from bugs, errors, and defects. I will work to create automated tests, integrated tests, and other tools and methods in order to make sure that our application is running as expected. In addition, I will participate in code review sessions and provide meaningful feedback.
 
  - ```3 technical strengths```: 
    - I am familiar working in a group environment to develop an medium-large scale applications through previous experiences. 
    - Through multiple projects and experiences, I have learned and familiarized myself with many of the tools and langauges we will be working on with this project such as Python, Java, React, JS, CSS.
    - I am comfortable performing collaboration-based development through Git and performing tasks such as code reviews, branch management, and pair programming.
    
  - ```3 technical weaknesses```: 
    - I have limited experience working in a mobile development environment and working with tools such as Swift, Android Studio, etc
    - I am unfamiliar with integrating third-party API's from existing products (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, ...) into an application and developing tools such as integrated video players, etc. 
    - This is my first time working to develop a real world application with my previous experiences being in an educational environment.

Nancy Zhao
