## Description

We completed a mobile application called Senior Simple Screen which offers quick access or simplified versions of Google, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Zoom, and Email.

All apps are accessible in Senior Simple Screen‚Äôs home page with large, clearly labelled icons, and either open into their respective apps or open into a version with trimmed down features - for example, YouTube simplified with a search bar, a single focus video, and five similar video suggestions.

### License

Senior Simple Screen is licensed under The MIT License.

### Next Steps

The Senior Simple Screen mobile application, built in React, works on Android via the APK file but not iOS due to the requirement of a developer account with a fee of around $99/year required to create an installable iOS app (IPA). As for what is remaining, there is opportunity for more apps to be added within the mobile application, as well as releasing it in iOS and in various App Stores.

1. The first thing you will want to do is get access to the apk file which stores our app and all of its information:
  a. Visit <https://github.com/csc301-fall-2020/team-project-20-family-service-toronto>
  b. At the top right, there is a green button labelled ‚Äúcode‚Äù. If you click it, there is an option to ‚Äúdownload ZIP‚Äù. Please click this.
  c. Now, on your device of choice, you will have access to the apk file in the ZIP folder under ‚Äú_deliverable-4/mobile/FamilyServicesToronto.apk_‚Äù
2. Once you have access to the apk file, you can do two things.
  a. The first thing you can do is publish the application to the google app store by following the instructions here: <https://developer.android.com/studio/publish> and then having your users install it through the store
  b. The second option is to directly install the apk on users android phones:
    i. Send the apk to users phone (preferably by connecting their device to the device with the apk and transferring it)
    ii. The you can simply be able to click the apk and click install
