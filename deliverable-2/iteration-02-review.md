# Senior Simple Screen Development Team

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

* When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
* Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. Weekly team meetings on Wednesdays at 8pm. In addition to our weekly sponsor team meeting on Tuesdays at 12pm, these video calls are a helpful way to update each other on our progress and allocate tasks for the next week. In these meetings we were also able to collaboratively make decisions more openly than through text or email.
2. Organizing meeting notes and important links through a Google Doc. At the top of our doc we have links to the recurring Zoom meetings, Github project and repo, and team availability on When2Meet, followed by notes from each of our meetings whether with the sponsor or just with the team. As sometimes not all members are able to attend meetings, this is a helpful way to quickly refer to and catch up on them. The links are also a central place to find them, as sometimes they can get lost in the group chat.
3. Having at least one other teammate review your PR before merging it in, requiring feedback allows everyone to gain more context into the areas others may have worked on independently, and to offer suggestions for improvements or things they have missed. Having multiple eyes on new changes, as well as the CI/CD, better ensures that no unintended issues make it into our deployed application.

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. In our roles and responsibilities listed out in Deliverable 1, we divided by parts of the stack, such as frontend, backend, fullstack, and quality assurance. However, the tasks ended up being allocated by area of the application, such as building out the page for Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Facebook, Email, etc. Since during the Deliverable 1 planning stages, we didn't have the selection of apps to include in our project, we did not think to divide the tasks as such - but regardless of the method of allocating tasks, our work came together for a functional proof of concept application.
2. Initially much of the communication and information sharing was done through our Facebook Messenger group chat, which if not caught up with immediately, could result in some links or updates lost further up in the chat. Also for recurring meetings, a meeting reminder message would be sent in the chat with the Zoom link each time. Around halfway through working on this deliverable, we decided to compile important information in the central Google Doc, which helped for referencing as well as to summarize key outcomes of text or meeting discussions.

### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why you are making a change.

## Product - Review

### Q4. How was your product demo?

* How did you prepare your demo?
* What did you manage to demo to your partner?
* Did your partner accept the features?
* Were there change requests?
* What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
* *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

We did a demo with our project partner Rodrigo on November 9th, 2020. We prepared for the demo by having the project open and ready to run when our meeting began. We ran the server locally and opened up google chrome to view the application. We used the chrome browser development tools to display our application in mobile view. Doing so allows Rodrigo to visualize how the application will look when we eventually convert it from a web application into a react native mobile application. In our demo, we showed Rodrigo the application home screen as well as one of the working components, namely Google. We have not yet completed our implementation of the other features on November 9th, which was why we only demoed the google component. We explained to Rodrigo that the other components would work similarly, which is when the component button is clicked, the user would be directed to the respective component pages. Rodrigo was very happy with our progress and accepted the features. There were no change requests. From our demo experience, we learned that what our team had in mind for the product and what Rodrigo had in mind for the product is congruent.
