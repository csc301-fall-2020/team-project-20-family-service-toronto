# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?
 
## Description (Answer)
 * Our application is like a hub for accessing the most important apps that seniors use on a day-to-day basis. When you open our application, you will see 5 links to commonly used apps (Facebook, Whatsapp, Google, Zoom, Youtube) and button to direct the user to links to 3 email options (Yahoo, Gmail, Outlook). Clicking on any of these 8 links will bring the user directly to the online application (or a simplified version of the application, which will be discussed later). All in all, our application allows a user to have all of his/her most-used apps in one place, eliminating any struggle with finding those applications in the first place. Likewise, some of these applications (such as Youtube) are simplified versions of the actual applications. These simplified versions aim to make users of our application less overwhelmed when accessing and utilizing specific applications nested in our app, because they have less options for what they can do in those applications (they only have access to essential features!). 
 * Our app attempts to solve the common troubles seniors have with accessing important apps on their phones. We have had several meetings with Rodrigo in which he outlines the struggles that seniors face on a day-to-day basis when trying to find, open and use apps on their phones. Seniors are much more easily overwhelmed by technology and the things that may go wrong with it (i.e. Zoom suddenly asking a senior to re-enter their password or enter the meeting ID) as well as all the instructions that come with navigating a certain application, given that many seniors did not grow up with any technology like younger generaions did. Our app aims to give seniors a less stressful encounter with technology by organizing all of their most-used apps all into one application (that is easy to find on their phone) and simplifying some of the user interfaces / features for certain apps nested within our main application. 
 * There is no context required to understand why the application solves this problem. As mentioned before, the application is like a hub for accessing the most useful apps in a single place (in a very organized manner), and also includes some simplifications of most commonly used apps. 

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

## Key Features (Answer)
*Main page:*
- A compilation of links/redirections to the seniors' most frequently used apps
- Keeps seniors' top applications all in one place, in an organized manner
- Eliminates need for seniors to scroll through their phone trying to find the apps that they want to access (instead they can just open up our main application!)
- Logos for each app are displayed so that seniors can remember that these were the apps that they had on their phones previously

*Google page:*
- Seniors have access to anything on the web (especially useful for seniors in particular because, as Rodrigo mentioned, they enjoy accessing reading materials online)
- Incredibly useful to have Google as part of our main application because it allows the seniors to access other ressources/applications that might not be available through our main application

*Whatsapp page:*
- One of the most used applications by seniors (as noted by Rodrigo)
- Seniors have access to messaging and phone calls through this application

*Facebook page:*
- Seniors have access to speaking with friends and family
- Seniors can also look through photos of their friends and family, or share their own photos

*Zoom page:*
- Seniors have access to video calls for meetings, or virtual time with friends and family

*Email section*
- Access to 3 different types of emails (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) 
- Seniors have all emails in one place
- Especially useful is a senior has more than one email account 
- Email has its own subsection so that the main page is not overwhelmed with all the different emails

*Youtube page:*
- Simplified version of youtube
- Allows seniors to easily search youtube videos without being distracted by all of the other youtube features (like account settings, etc.)
- Allows seniors to see video recommendations based on their search

*Back button:*
- Back button below applications (after having clicked on a certain app) allows seniors to easily navigate back to the main page
- Reminds them that they are in our application rather than in an app on their phone


## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
