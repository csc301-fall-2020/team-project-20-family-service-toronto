# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?
 
 * Our application is like a hub for accessing the most important apps that seniors use on a day-to-day basis. When you open our application, you will see 6 links to commonly used apps (Facebook, Whatsapp, Gmail, Google, Zoom, Youtube). Clicking on any of these links will bring the user directly to the application (or a simplified version of the application, which will be discussed later) which allows the user to have all of their most-used apps in one place which eliminates any struggle with finding those apps in the first place. Likewise, some of these applications (such as Youtube) are simplified versions of the actual applications that seniors might have on their phones. These simplified versions aim to make seniors less overwhelmed when using these specific apps because they have less options in what to do while inside the app (they only have access to essential features!). 
 * Our app attempts to solve the common troubles seniors have with accessing important apps on their phones. We have had several meetings with Rodrigo in which he outlines the struggles that seniors face on a day-to-day basis when trying to find, and open apps such as Zoom and have a video call with a friend. Seniors are much more easily overwhelmed by technology and things going wrong with it (i.e. Zoom suddenly asking them to re-enter their password or enter the meeting ID) as opposed to the younger generation, given that many seniors did not grow up with any technology at all. Our app aims to give seniors a less stressful encounter with technology by organizing all of their most-used apps all into one application (that is easy to find on their phone) and simplifying some of the user interfaces / features for certain apps. 
 * There is no context required to understand why the application solves this problem. As mentioned before, the application is like a hub for accessing the most useful apps in a single place in an organized manner, and also includes some simplifications of the commonly used apps. The way in which the app solves the problem mentioned above is self-explanatory.

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

* Key Features:
* Main page: A compilation of links to the most frequently used apps
* Youtube page: 
* Back button in most apps



## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
